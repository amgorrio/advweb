<p>Time is limited. The amount of places people can go to are limited by the amount of time an individual has. People remember certain times an event has occured, they also remember places they have been. People can't go back in time, but they can go back to a place they have been to and relive that memory. Every new second brings forth the future and no place stays the same over time.
